Tie::Hash::Cannabinol

WHAT IS Tie::Hash::Cannabinol?

Tie::Hash::Cannabinol is a Perl module which "extends" the 
functionality of Perl hashes so that they forget almost anything 
you tell them.

HOW DO I INSTALL IT?

Tie::Hash::Cannabinol uses the standard Perl module architecture and can
therefore be installed using the standard Perl method which, in brief, goes 
something like this:

   gzip -cd Tie-Hash-Cannabinol-X.XX.tar.gz | tar xvf -
   cd Tie-Hash-Cannabinol-X.XX
   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

Where X.XX is the version number of the module which you are 
installing.

If this doesn't work for you then creating a directory called Tie/Hash 
somewhere in your Perl library path (@INC) and copying the Cannabinol.pm file 
into this directory should also do the trick.

WHERE IS THE DODUMENTATION?

All of the documentation is currently in POD format in the Cannabinol.pm
file. If you install the module using the standard method you should be able 
to read it by typing

   perldoc Tie::Hash::Cannabinol

at a comand prompt.

LATEST VERSION

The latest version of this module will always be available from 
CPAN or from http://code.mag-sol.com.
